            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Advertiſed to be <hi>Silent, Attentive,</hi> and <hi>Read to Obey,</hi> what
is commanded, either by Drum or Verbal Expreſſion.</p>
                  <p n="6">VI. If the Regiment be compleat, every company may make a
Plotton, which makes ſix Plottons upon each Wing; but if con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderably
weakned, a Wing may be divid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into four Plottons, which ought to be the
leaſt number, to give time to charge again, and be ready by that time the
Fire is round, that the Battalion, if there be occaſion, may entertain a
continual Fire.</p>
                  <p n="7">VII. The Officers commanding Plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons, ſhall place
themſelves each in the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of his Plotton; that when the Battalion
advances they may march in a Rank two Paces before the Front of their Men. But
when the ſignal or Command to Halt, and make ready, is given, they ſhall
enter the firſt Rank of the Plottons; ſo that the Muzzels of the laſt
rank may be advanced beyond their Bodies.</p>
                  <p n="8">VIII. To prevent diſorders, its fit the whole Battalion,
in advancing towards the Enemy, halt when ſome Plottons are order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed 
<pb facs="tcp:180229:82"/>to fire, rather than to command the Plattons out of the Battalion;
which is the moſt uſual viſible reaſon of the Defeat of the Troops; And
therefore above all things ought to be avoided with all poſſible car<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

underſtand his Trade, and will not fail to lay hold on the confuſions which

                  <p n="9">IX. When the Battalion is ordered to Halt, that ſome
Plattons may fire according as (to the judgement of the Commander) they ſtand
beſt for Execution; The firſt Rank of the Plotton, which are to fire, kneek
and the other two Ranks, which are ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed beſt (in the diſpoſition
made for fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) to be at two paces diſtance, cloſes as (at the Wood the

thruſting of their left feet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt thoſe of their Leaders, that the
muz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zels of the laſt Rank may be advanced be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond their Officers, and
ſtanding upright ſhall wait the command for fireing, the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> being no neceſſity for the
ſecond Rank ſtoop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which is an uneaſie poſture, and, by the
concluſion of ſome Souldiers judgement, may endanger the kneeling Rank.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:180229:82"/>
                  <p n="10">X. As ſoon as the Plotton ſhall have fire the
ſecond and third Rank opens withou furder command to them for ſo doing, to
their paces diſtance, that they might have room to charge their Pikes
immediatly without expecting order for it, whether mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to the Enemy,
Halting or Retiring, of which particulars a continual habit muſt be given to
the Souldiers: So that there be no neceſſity of a particular word of
Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand; the firſt rank kneels, the other two cloſes up, levelling well
their Pieces, and taking Aim, by bringing up the butt-end of them nearer their
Shoulders than of late times is uſual in Exerciſe, of not preſenting
their Pieces though kneeling, and clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed up, without a command of their
Officers, no more than of firing, tho already preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, without his Orders,
becauſe that if the battalion be attacqued by horſe, and the Commander, to
avoid confuſion, choſing rather to keep his fire whole, till they be very
cloſe, and then to fire by Plottons, u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon a mint of the enemies ſquadron,
as break in upon his Battalion think fit to cauſe it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent without
deſign of firing at that diſtance, ſometimes makes the firſt rank of
the ſqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron not only to ſtoop ſhort, but fall in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion 
<pb facs="tcp:180229:83"/>upon thoſe that follow, but to bring the Souldiers to a cuſtom
of this laſt parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, they muſt in Exerciſe be often accuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed,
&amp; commanded to preſent &amp; recover again their Arms without firing,
telling them at the ſame time the reaſon for i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly at the ſame time of Action, and
a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Horſe. The Commander judging it ſafeſt to manage his firſt
fire, leaſt their quick motion might prevent the ſecond.</p>
                  <p n="11">XI. If the commanding Officer of a plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, be not
altogether perſwaded of his ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers Patience, and exact Obedience, as to
the order of firing to prevent a confuſed fire, he ſhall march ſoftly,
according to the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the line, with ſhouldred Musquers, permitting
none to make ready, but ſuch plottons as he intends immediatly ſhall
fire.</p>
                  <p n="12">XII. When a whole Line of Foot matches in order of Battel
to the Enemy, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders of the reſpective Battalions ſhall have a
ſpecial care to regulate their pace according to the motions of the Line; it
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing apparent, that when both Armies are very near, the Battalion that
advances be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Front of his line, will readily be flanked, and by its
defeat give the Enemy <pb facs="tcp:180229:83"/>opportunity to flank the Battalion to the
right and left at the ſame time they are at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack'd in the Front, which may
prove a dangerous Conſequence, this precaution is neceſſary at all times,
but moſt of all in cloſe and covered grounds when the Troops are hindered
(and ſeparated) the ſight of each other, in which caſe they ought to have
ſome Officer, or good Serjeants, on both the Flanks, to bring the Commander
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual notice of the Motion of the Troops to his right and left, that he
may be found nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther too backward, nor too forward, at the approach of the
Enemy.</p>
                  <p n="13">XIII. All Officers, particulary comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and Majors,
marching in the Line of Battel to the Enemy, ought to know the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in which
the Troops are Embattelled, at leaſt of their own Brigade, and of that which
they were to ſuſtain, or is appointed to ſuſtain them according as they
are Poſted in the firſt or ſecond line, and know by ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial remarks to
diſcern their own Troops from thoſe of the Enemys. To the End that in the
confuſions, to which thoſe gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Actions are ſubject, that they may
not take the one before the other, which is alſo moſt of all to be
apprehended and prevented in cloſe and covered ground where the troops 
<pb facs="tcp:180229:84"/>are ſeparated; and it often falls out, that Men are deceived on
this Account.</p>
                  <p n="14">XIV. In cace a Battalion might be orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, or
otherwiſe obliged to retire without being put in confuſion, or Beat, after
warning given not to be affrighted, and telling them the reaſon of ſuch a
motion, whether to make place for Troops of the Second Line coming to relieve
it; or being diſadvantageouſly poſted, or preſſ with number of
Enemies, to poſt it ſelf behind in better ground, or that a whole Brigade,
or Line, whoſe motion the Battalion were obliged to obſerve, were Retiring,
the Commander and Officer com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding plottons, ſhall have a care it

about, and having made their fire, ſhall gain their Intervals, which they
ſhall have loſt in the Battalions charging their Pieces as they march, and
